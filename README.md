# coding-agent-guard

A plugin for Claude Code, Codex and Antigravity that checks what reaches the
coding agent from outside and what the agent sends out. Codex gets all of it
except output redaction (see [Codex](#codex)); Antigravity withholds output that
holds a secret instead of redacting it (see [Antigravity](#antigravity)).

| When | Checks | On a hit |
|---|---|---|
| After a shell, web or MCP tool runs | Secrets and personal IDs | Redacted before Claude sees the output; the transcript keeps the redacted copy only |
| | Invisible Unicode (zero-width, bidi, tag characters) | Removed |
| | Instruction-like text in output from outside | A note tells Claude it is data |
| Before a call that leaves the machine | Secrets and personal IDs in the call, the files it uploads, the staged diff of a commit, the commits of a push | Blocked, with the kind named and the value never repeated |
| | Instruction-like text and your warn rules in text a person will read | A note, or a block for a rule with `"block": true` |

It never checks your own prompts.

## What it detects

- **Secret shapes:** AWS, GitHub, GitLab, Atlassian, Slack, Anthropic, Google,
  Stripe, npm and Jenkins tokens, JWTs, private keys, Azure account keys,
  bearer headers, passwords in URLs, connection strings, YAML and JSON.
  Placeholders such as `${DB_PASSWORD}` or `<password>` are left alone.
- **Known values:** any environment variable whose name contains token, secret,
  password, api key, private key or credential, plus Windows Credential Manager
  entries you list. These match exactly, whatever their shape.
- **Personal IDs:** Finnish henkilötunnus, check character verified.
- **Injection:** "ignore previous instructions" and variants, fake role tags
  and lines, "don't tell the user", requests to send credentials somewhere,
  hidden tag characters.

Pattern lists are defence in depth, not a guarantee. A reworded injection or a
secret of an unknown shape gets through.

## Install

The easiest way is to let your coding agent do it. Paste this into Claude Code or Codex:

```text
Install coding-agent-guard by following https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kolbasik/coding-agent-guard/main/llms-install.md
```

[`llms-install.md`](llms-install.md) walks the agent through checking Python,
installing the plugin, testing that it blocks and redacts, optional settings
and the optional scoring server. It asks you before it installs software or
picks where suspect text may be sent. To do it by hand instead:

Needs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) or Python 3.8+ on `PATH`, and `sh` (on
Windows, the Git Bash Claude Code already uses). With uv, the hook runs through
`uv run` and uv supplies the Python.

Claude Code:

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add kolbasik/coding-agent-guard
claude plugin install coding-agent-guard@kolbasik
```

Inside Claude Code the same is `/plugin marketplace add kolbasik/coding-agent-guard`
then `/plugin install coding-agent-guard@kolbasik`. Restart Claude Code so the
hooks load. Update with `claude plugin update coding-agent-guard@kolbasik`.

Codex reads the same marketplace (tested with Codex 0.162.1):

```sh
codex plugin marketplace add kolbasik/coding-agent-guard
codex plugin add coding-agent-guard@kolbasik
```

Codex runs a plugin's hooks only after you trust them, so start `codex` once
and approve them. See [Codex](#codex) for what differs there.

Antigravity (`agy`) installs it from a clone (tested with agy 1.3.3):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kolbasik/coding-agent-guard.git
agy plugin install ./coding-agent-guard
```

That copies the clone into `~/.gemini/config/plugins/coding-agent-guard`; after
a `git pull`, install it again to update. See [Antigravity](#antigravity) for
what differs there.

To run it without installing, clone it
(`git clone https://github.com/kolbasik/coding-agent-guard.git`) and register
`scripts/guard.py in` as a `PostToolUse` hook and `scripts/guard.py out` as a
`PreToolUse` hook, with the matchers from `hooks/hooks.json`.

**Speed.** The hook starts a Python process on every tool call, so the
interpreter matters more than the code. On Windows ARM64 the `python` on `PATH`
is often the x64 build running under emulation. Measured per local call on one
machine (2026-09-29): 130–146 ms with it, 61 ms with a venv on the native
build. Let uv pick the native build and make the venv next to the scripts:

```sh
uv venv --managed-python --python 3.12 .venv     # in this repo; set UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR to keep the interpreter here too
```

`scripts/run` uses `.venv` when it exists. For a hook registered by hand, name
`.venv/Scripts/python.exe` (Windows) or `.venv/bin/python` as the exec-form
`command`, with `guard.py` in `args`. Asking uv on every call instead
(`uv run --no-project`) adds about 25 ms per call; a precompiled entry saves
only about 4 ms, because Python already caches the bytecode of every imported
module.

## Codex

Codex's `PostToolUse` hook cannot replace a tool's output, so under Codex a
secret in command, web or MCP output reaches the model. The guard still finds
it: the model gets a note not to repeat, store or send it, and you get a
warning (and a desktop notification with `notify: "desktop"`). Everything else
works as under Claude Code: secrets leaving the machine are blocked, and
instruction-like text gets a note. Codex sets no `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, so the
project settings are found from the session's working folder.

## Antigravity

Antigravity's hooks can neither redact a tool's output nor add a note beside
it, so under `agy` the guard does what they allow (measured with agy 1.3.3 on
2026-10-11):

- Output holding a secret is withheld whole: the model gets only the guard's
  reason and can run the command again so that it prints no values. agy itself
  still shows the raw output in its terminal and keeps it in its step files.
- Notes (instruction-like text in output from outside, warn-rule hits in
  outgoing text) reach the model through agy's `PreInvocation` hook, just before
  its next call. They wait in `~/.claude/coding-agent-guard/agy-pending/`.
- Secrets leaving the machine are blocked as under Claude Code, and the model
  sees the reason. MCP calls are checked as `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, so the
  same `text_tools` and `local_tools` patterns apply.
- agy blocks a call, or drops its output, when a hook fails or times out, so
  under agy the guard lets the call through on an internal error.

The `PreInvocation` hook starts Python before every model call: about 0.24 s
each on a Windows ARM64 VM with the venv (2026-10-11). agy sets no
`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`; the project settings are found from the session's
workspace folder.

## Configure

Optional. `~/.claude/coding-agent-guard/settings.json` and `<project>/.claude/coding-agent-guard/settings.json`
are read in that order, and every list extends the built-in one.

| Key | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `external_commands` | Regexes for shell commands whose output comes from outside, added to curl, wget, gh, aws, ssh and similar |
| `outbound_commands` | Regexes for shell commands that send data off the machine, added to curl, gh, git commit/push, scp and similar |
| `text_commands` | Outbound commands whose text a person reads; warn rules apply to them |
| `text_tools` | The same for non-shell tools, by tool-name regex |
| `local_tools` | Tool-name regexes whose input stays on this machine, so secret shapes in it are not blocked |
| `secret_patterns` | Extra `{"name", "pattern"}` secret shapes; a group named `v` marks the secret part |
| `secret_env` | Extra environment variable names whose values are secrets |
| `credential_manager_filters` | Windows Credential Manager target filters whose values are secrets, e.g. `"myapp/*"` |
| `warn` | `{"name", "pattern", "message"?, "commands"?, "block"?}` rules for outgoing text; `commands` limits a rule to matching commands, `"block": true` denies the call instead of adding a note |
| `classifier_url` | Base URL of a scoring server (below); empty turns the model check off |
| `classifier_threshold` | Score at or above which a model flags the output; default `0.9` |
| `classifier_timeout` | Seconds to wait for the server before falling back to patterns; default `5`. Keep it at 40 or less: the output hook is stopped after 60 s, and a stopped hook drops its redactions too |
| `classifier_token_env` | Environment variable holding the server's bearer token; default `CODING_AGENT_GUARD_TOKEN` |
| `log_file` | JSON Lines file with one line per checked call (relative paths resolve against the project); empty turns logging off |
| `samples_file` | JSON Lines file keeping the redacted text of outputs flagged as injections, up to 50,000 characters each; empty (default) keeps none |
| `notify` | `"desktop"` pops a notification for confirmed findings; `"none"` (default) only shows the line in Claude Code |

The four `classifier_*` keys, `log_file`, `samples_file` and `notify` replace the default rather than extending it.

**Notifications and the log.** A *confirmed* finding is a blocked secret or
personal ID, or an injection a model flagged and the Claude judge did not clear.
It shows a warning line to the user in Claude Code (`systemMessage`) and, with
`notify: "desktop"`, a Windows toast, macOS notification or `notify-send`.
`log_file` gets one line per call: every tool output, every outgoing call, and
anything with a finding (redactions, pattern hits, cleared flags, blocks,
warnings, an unreachable server), with its time, session, tool, program names,
Jira keys, URL host, scores, whether Claude was asked, and how long the hook
took. The text is kept only as its length and a hash of its redacted form; no
text and no secret is written.

**Flagged texts.** With `samples_file` set, the redacted text of every output a
model or pattern flagged as an injection is kept there, linked to its log line
by `sha256`, so false alarms and real attacks can be studied later. Unflagged
text is never kept. The file holds real attacks and whatever the flagged source
contained, so keep it out of version control and do not open it in Claude Code:
the Read tool is not checked by the hook.

**Stats.** `python scripts/stats.py [--days 7] [--by day|week]` reads the log
and prints, per day or week, how many calls came in and from outside, how many
went to Claude, were flagged, confirmed or blocked, and the hook's latency; how
outside texts spread over the score range; and a what-if table showing how many
texts Claude would see, and how many of its confirmed injections would be kept,
at other classifier and screen thresholds. It prints numbers only.

```json
{
  "external_commands": ["jira-cli"],
  "outbound_commands": ["jira-cli"],
  "text_commands": ["jira-cli"],
  "credential_manager_filters": ["myapp/*"],
  "warn": [{ "name": "internal-host", "pattern": "\\.corp\\.internal\\b", "message": "names an internal host" }]
}
```

## Optional: a model-based check

Patterns miss reworded injections. A small classifier catches more, but
loading one costs seconds, so it runs as a long-lived server, on your machine
or on another one with more memory. Output from outside is sent to it
already redacted, and a score over the threshold adds to Claude's note. If the
server is down, the hook falls back to patterns and the call goes through.

On the server machine, from a copy of this repo (needs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/);
everything stays inside the repo folder):

```sh
sh scripts/setup-server.sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/server.py --model models/horizon-guard-base \
    --host <address the client reaches> --port 8765
```

On Windows, run the setup from Git Bash and start `.venv/Scripts/python.exe`
instead; the script prints the right command. On the same machine as the
agent, use `127.0.0.1` for the address on both sides.

Set `CODING_AGENT_GUARD_TOKEN` on both sides to require a bearer token.

On an Apple silicon Mac, `sh skills/coding-agent-guard/scripts/setup-mac.sh --host <address>`
does all of the above plus Ollaya (pinned `v0.7.5`, checksums verified; an installed
copy of that version is reused) with `laya:en`, and installs two LaunchAgents so
Ollaya and the server start at login and restart if they stop. Add
`--claude-model claude-sonnet-5 --claude-token-file <file>` for the Claude judge, or
`--chat-model gemma4:cloud` (with Ollama running there) to judge with an Ollama model
instead, or `--agy-model gemini-3.8-flash-low` (with `agy` installed and signed in there),
and `--codex-model gpt-6.1-sol` (with the `codex` CLI installed and logged in
there) to judge text from Codex sessions with Codex. It is safe to run again.

### Which model

Measured with `bench/score.py` on 2026-09-29, on held-out test splits only:

| Model | deepset caught | xTRam1 caught | False alarms, published benign | False alarms, our tickets and notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Horizon-Labs prompt-injection-guard-base, 0.5 | 65% | 80.5% | 0.7% | 3–10% |
| same, 0.9 | 38% | 56% | 0.4% | 3.3% |
| Prompt Guard 2 86M, full precision, 0.5 | 17% | 46% | 0.2% | 0–2% |

Horizon-Labs (Apache-2.0, ungated) is the default. Its training data includes
`deepset` train and all of NVIDIA's indirect-injection set, so scores on those
sets mean nothing for it; the table uses what it did not see. It was six days
old when measured and its publisher's own benchmarks are unaudited. At 0.5 its
false alarms on real tickets are too noisy on their own, which is what the judge
below is for.

How the pieces combine, on the same held-out sets plus
[AgentInjectionBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ppradyoth/AgentInjectionBench)
(142 injections inside tool output, 40 attack-adjacent benign controls; not in
Horizon-Labs' training data), measured 2026-09-29:

| Setup | Caught: deepset / xTRam1 / AgentInjectionBench | False alarms, our texts | Our texts sent to Claude |
|---|---|---|---|
| Horizon-Labs alone, 0.9 | 38% / 56% / 65% | 2.5% | – |
| Horizon-Labs → `--confirm laya:en` | 48% / 75.5% / 67% | 3.3% | 3% (to annotate) |
| Horizon-Labs 0.5 or more → Claude | 65% / 80.5% / 70% | 2.5% | 5% |
| **Horizon-Labs 0.5 or `--screen laya:en` 0.5 or more → Claude** | **83% / 94% / 79%** | 2.9% | 40% |

The last row is what `setup-mac.sh` installs when a Claude judge is given. On
AgentInjectionBench every setup raised the same 6 false alarms of 40, all from
Horizon-Labs at 0.9 or more; Claude cleared 5 of them, so 1 reached the user as
a notification. Claude's verdicts across these runs: every injection it was
shown kept, 26 of 27 benign texts cleared.

On the client, set `classifier_url` to `http://<that address>:8765` and put the
same token in the `CODING_AGENT_GUARD_TOKEN` environment variable.

- `fetch_model.py` downloads only ungated models, at a pinned revision, and
  checks every large file against the hub's SHA-256.
- Any ONNX sequence classifier with `tokenizer.json` and an `id2label` config
  works; repeat `--model` to run several side by side.
- `--confirm <model>` asks a decision model served by [Ollaya](https://ollaya.dev)
  for a second opinion, only when a classifier scores at least `--confirm-above`
  (default 0.5). With the client's threshold at 0.9 this is a cascade: the
  classifier flags alone when sure, and the second model can flag what it was
  unsure of. Measured on 2026-09-29, Horizon-Labs confirmed by `laya:en` caught
  48% / 75.5% (deepset / xTRam1) against 38% / 56% for Horizon-Labs alone at 0.9,
  with the same false-alarm rate on real tickets (3.3%). `laya:en` on its own
  flagged 20–45% of ordinary tickets and notes, so use it only as a confirmer.
  Other confirmers, same test: `winnow:e4b` 41.7% / 67.2% (363 ms per call on an
  M5 Pro GPU), `decider:4b` 38.3% / 60.2% (2.9 s, CPU), `qwen3guard`, `kev`,
  `jevk5` and `nli` 55.6–58.1% on xTRam1, no better than Horizon-Labs alone.
  `laya:en` or `winnow:e4b` together reach 50.0% / 78.4%. These rates rest on
  60 benign texts per source, and a confirmer's false alarms on the 8 benign
  texts Horizon-Labs was unsure of, so read small differences as noise.
- `--screen <model>` scores every text with a decision model served by Ollaya
  that never flags on its own: at `--screen-above` (default 0.5) it sends the
  text to the Claude judge, and only Claude's verdict can flag it. laya:en
  screens well because it catches attacks Horizon-Labs misses and Claude throws
  out its many false alarms. It needs `--claude-model`, adds about 70 ms to every
  text, and sends roughly 40% of ordinary tickets and notes to Claude.
- `--claude-model claude-sonnet-5` asks a locked-down `claude -p` about text a classifier
  flags or is unsure of (`--claude-above`, default 0.9; 0.5 lets Claude decide
  Horizon-Labs' unsure band) or that a screen sends: no thinking, tools, settings
  sources, MCP servers, skills or saved session, its own empty config folder and
  working folder, telemetry and update checks off, $0.05 cap. Its verdict is
  added to the note (`model:claude`, or `claude-judge:ordinary-data`) and never
  removes a classifier's 0.9 warning, because the judge read the suspect text;
  below 0.9 its verdict decides. Over ssh the macOS
  keychain is locked, so log it in with `claude setup-token` and
  `--claude-token-file`; `--bare` and `CLAUDE_CODE_SIMPLE` refuse subscription
  logins. Measured 2026-09-29 on 30 flagged injections and 10 flagged benign
  texts: Sonnet without thinking kept 30/30 and cleared 10/10 in 1.9 s (p50);
  Haiku with thinking 28/30 in 5.1 s (up to 25 s); Haiku without thinking 23/30.
  Measured 2026-10-07, thinking off, on the 428 texts a `bench/judge.py --band`
  run sent Claude (280 injections from deepset and xTRam1; 148 benign, 92 of
  them our own tickets and notes):

  | Judge | Injections missed | False alarms | p50 | Slowest |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `claude-sonnet-5` | 6 | 15 | 1.7 s | 4.6 s |
  | `claude-sonnet-5-5` | 21 | 10 | 2.0 s | 14.4 s |
  | `claude-haiku-5-5` | 47 | 8 | 1.6 s | 5.3 s |

  Give a full model ID. `sonnet` and `haiku` are CLI aliases that move when the
  CLI updates: with CLI 2.1.292, `sonnet` means Sonnet 5.5 and `haiku` still
  means Haiku 4.5. When the pinned model is retired, the judge fails and its
  scores show `claude_error`.
- `--codex-model gpt-6.1-sol` judges text from Codex sessions with a locked-down
  `codex exec` instead (no user config, rules, hooks, plugins, ChatGPT apps,
  skills or saved session; the shell, sub-agent and code-mode features off;
  read-only sandbox; reasoning effort low); text from Claude Code sessions still
  goes to Claude. The sandbox stays as the backstop for any tool a later Codex
  adds. Measured 2026-10-10 and 2026-10-11 with
  Codex CLI 0.162.1 on the public band (122 injections, 53 benign texts from
  deepset and xTRam1; our own tickets and notes were not sent to OpenAI;
  `bench/judge.py --band codex-<model> --public-only --also ollaya-laya-en:0.5`):

  | Judge | Injections caught | False alarms | p50 | Slowest |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `claude-sonnet-5` (same texts) | 117 | 13 | 1.7 s | 4.6 s |
  | `gpt-6.1-sol` | 117 | 27 | 5.1 s | 11.0 s |
  | `gpt-5.6-sol` | 103 | 15 | 3.8 s | 12.4 s |
  | `gpt-5.6-terra` | 100 | 15 | 3.7 s | 7.9 s |
  | `gpt-5.6-luna` | 95 | 13 | 3.4 s | 10.9 s |
  | `gpt-6-sol` | 99 | 19 | 3.6 s | 11.9 s |
  | `gpt-6-luna` | 70 | 10 | 3.2 s | 14.5 s |

  These rows were measured before the shell, sub-agents and code mode were
  switched off. Re-run with them off on 2026-10-11, `gpt-6.1-sol` caught 116
  with 31 false alarms (p50 4.8 s, slowest 10.3 s): the same within run-to-run
  noise, since the 5 texts whose verdict changed flip either way when judged
  again, with either set of flags.

  So a Codex judge misses more injections than Claude, or raises more false
  alarms: use it when text from Codex sessions must stay with OpenAI.
  `gpt-6.1-sol` is the suggested model: it caught as many as Sonnet 5 at twice
  the false alarms, and by third-party list prices of 2026-10-04 it costs $2 /
  $10 per million input / output tokens against `gpt-5.6-sol`'s $5 / $30.
  `gpt-6-astra` was only screened on 48 texts of the band (24 of 24 caught, 13
  false alarms of 24). The judge draws on the same ChatGPT usage limit as your
  Codex sessions: once that is used up, scores show `codex_error` until it
  resets, and the classifier's flags still stand.
- `--judge-url` / `--judge-model` add an open-weight LLM as a further opinion,
  through any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp).
  `--judge-above 0.5` asks it only when a classifier already scores 0.5 or more,
  so it costs its seconds only on suspect text. `openai/gpt-oss-safeguard-20b`
  (Apache-2.0, ungated, about 14 GB) is built for classifying against a written
  policy; `ibm-granite/granite-guardian-3.3-8b` also takes custom criteria.
  Ollama's cloud models work through the same endpoint. Measured 2026-10-10
  with Ollama 0.40.1 on the public band (122 injections, 53 benign texts from
  deepset and xTRam1; `bench/judge.py --band chat-<model> --public-only`):

  | Judge | Injections caught | False alarms | p50 | Slowest |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `claude-sonnet-5` (same texts) | 117 | 13 | 1.7 s | 4.6 s |
  | `gemma4:cloud` | 117 | 13 | 1.0 s | 4.1 s |
  | `glm-5.3:cloud` | 115 | 17 | 8.1 s | 67.7 s |
  | `deepseek-v4.1-flash:cloud` | 117 | 27 | 1.9 s | 7.2 s |
  | `glm-5.3-flash:cloud` | 119 of 121 | 22 | 3.4 s | 120 s (1 timeout) |
  | `deepseek-v4-pro:cloud` | 107 | 19 | 3.4 s | 13.7 s |

  `gemma4:cloud` matched Sonnet 5 on these texts at about half the time. A
  `:cloud` model sends the text to Ollama's cloud, so our own tickets and notes
  were not part of this run.
- `--chat-model gemma4:cloud` makes such a model the judge in Claude's place:
  it decides the same suspect text, reported as the score `chat`, and its
  verdict annotates or confirms a flag exactly as Claude's does. It talks to
  `--chat-url`, by default the local Ollama (`http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`), and
  every text it judges goes wherever that endpoint sends it; for a `:cloud`
  model that is Ollama's cloud. Codex sessions keep a `--codex-model` judge if
  one is set. `--claude-model` and `--chat-model` are one or the other.
- `--agy-model gemini-3.8-flash-low` makes the Antigravity CLI (`agy`) the
  judge in Claude's place, reported as the score `agy`; Codex sessions keep a
  `--codex-model` judge if one is set. It runs a tool-less custom agent with no
  skills, plugins, rules, MCP servers or hooks, from its own home and workspace
  folders under `.cache/agy-judge`, so nothing from your own agy setup loads.
  The text goes on stdin, every text it judges goes to Google, and the copy agy
  saves of each conversation is deleted once the verdict is in. Measured
  2026-10-11 with agy 1.3.3 on the same public band:

  | Judge | Injections caught | False alarms | p50 | Slowest |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `claude-sonnet-5` (same texts) | 117 | 13 | 1.7 s | 4.6 s |
  | `gemini-3.8-flash-low` | 111 | 18 | 7.9 s | 74.7 s |

  Most of each call is agy starting up. `--claude-model`, `--chat-model` and
  `--agy-model` are one or the other; on macOS the separate home folder is
  untested.
- Models are not bundled. Check a model's licence before sharing it; Prompt
  Guard 2, for one, is under the Llama 4 Community License.

`bench/score.py` compares models on two published datasets
(`deepset/prompt-injections` for direct injections, NVIDIA's
`Nemotron-RL-Agentic-Indirect-Prompt-Injection-v1` for injections planted in
records) and on benign text you point it at, to measure false alarms on your own
traffic. It prints rates only, never sample text.

It also scores decision models: any model an [Ollaya](https://ollaya.dev) server
runs (`--ollaya laya decider:4b qwen3guard ...`) or Ollama 0.35+ serves at
`/v1/systemone` (`--ollama tev1:4b nimble:9b`), asked the same two questions
from laya's guard preset, and laya through its own package (`--laya`). Each run
saves per-sample scores (label, source, score; no text), and
`--combine` then compares "any model", "at least 2", mean score and every
two-model cascade without scoring again. A cascade is what `server.py` does with
`--judge-above`: the first model flags alone when sure and asks the second when
unsure. `--export-benign FILE` copies your benign text into one file for scoring
on another machine with `--benign-file`.

## Behaviour to know

- **Fail-open.** A guard error lets the call through and prints
  `coding-agent-guard: internal error ... this call was not checked`.
- **Notes on outgoing text arrive after the call.** Secrets, personal IDs and
  `"block": true` rules are the only things stopped beforehand.
- **Rules see the text a person reads**: the command minus arguments that name
  local files or folders, plus body files. Not the tool's description field,
  and not a commit's code, so a rule never trips on an upload path or a diff.
- **Read is not filtered**, so Claude can still get a file's exact bytes to
  edit it.
- **Cost:** about 200 ms per checked call when Python is started directly,
  plus about 100 ms for the `sh` launcher the plugin uses.
- **Commands count where they run, not where they are mentioned**: after `;`,
  `&&`, `|` or inside `$( )`, behind `rtk`, `sudo`, `env`, `timeout` or `VAR=x`,
